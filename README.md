### A Project to Help Make Team Finding Less Horrible
## Team Members
* Cassidy Haas ( @cassidyhhaas )
* Ryan Turner ( @ryan-turner )
* Dante Pasionek ( @Dpasi314 )
* Pierce Doogan ( @pierce-doogan )
* Jeffrey Lipnick ( @jefferylipnick )


## What does it do?
We are creating a web application to match students in a course for group projects, based on parameters like skills (and level of proficiency in that skill), availability, interests, and previous courses taken.

## Our Vision
Make finding groups, just a little less terrible.

## Motivation
We recognise the need for a group making facilitator for computer science class projects, becauseit is often challenging to build a group when you do not already personally know people in the course. As a result, many groups end up randomly joining together, leading to uneven distribution of skills across the group, which makes group cohesion difficult, thus justifying the need for this kind of web application.

## Risks
* Lack of experience in web application development
* Many of the team members do not know each other previous to starting this project
* Integration of multiple programming languages
* Lack of shared language skills across the group

## Mitigation Strategy
* Breaking up the project into pieces aht distributing them to members due to strength and experience
* Keeping the pieces of the assignment small
* Pair programming on pieces of the assignments when necessary to ensure complicated pieces are implemented effectively
* Meeting regularly to stay connected on the pieces of the project, and to collaborate on solving problems a member may encounter

## Requirements
### User Stories - (6 is hardest, 1 is easiest)

ID (Binary) | Description | Rating
------------|-------------|--------
00000001 | As a creator, I want to be able to define the parameters students can search with when determining their groups. | 4
00000010 | As a student, I want to be able to filter groups by project type, so I can work with someone who has similar interest. | 3
00000011 | As a student, I want to be able to find groups that are familiar with the same languages I am, so that we can work fluidly and effectively. | 3
00000100 | As a creator, I want to be able to set how large groups can be within the class, so as to control group sizes per assignments given. | 1
00000101 | As a student, I want to be notified when someone would like to be in a group with me, so I can respond to them in a timely manner. | 5
00000110 | As a student, I want to be able to filter by availability to work with people in person on a more consistent basis. | 6

## Methodology
We plan to use the Agile methodology to keep in line with Part 2 of the project and to accommodate for the scope of the project.
